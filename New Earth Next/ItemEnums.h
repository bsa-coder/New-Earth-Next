/* TODO list 2017-08-28
 Add bank account to control page
 Add good-better-best to store/detail selection (so list isn't giant)
 Add TOTAL STATUS (combine sustain scores for each resource into one value >=0 good <0 bad)
 Add CONTRACT DAY (number of days passed in contract)(maybe countdown is better) to control page
 Add ProgressToGoal (how close are we to the milestone)
 DONE: Add Warehouse page to show placed and unplaced units (maybe health, etc)
 DONE: Check Repair-Wearout in DoProduction (seems to stop) - number type wrong ... integer versus float
 Fix UnitName - and use it in notes (who gave notice) (old format was TYPE+LOC)
 Fix MapScaleOnReturn - after buying unit and returning to map the zoomscale = 1 and not last value
 Add BuyIt to Detail page
 Change Detail:DONE to return to Store (and stay there)
 Change BuyIt unit placement orientation so rotated perpendicular to slope
 Save GameState on exit (write to file so can open at last state)
 Add END/QUIT to stop the game (or restart it)
 Add Open Last (to open game from exit state)
 DONE: Fix MapZoomScale for status bar when zooming
 Add TotalStatus to ???
 DONE: Fix bug - in landscape, buyit puts unit in the wrong position (far to the right and maybe down a bit)

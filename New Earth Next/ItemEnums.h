/* TODO list 2017-08-28
 
 Newly placed units start with health = 100 ... but should grow to 100 while being built
 Change fill color of ENVELOPE to get rid of the square
 Change table views of warehouse and store to be parent>>detail view and back
 Allow the user to place the HQ themselves
 Expand the active map from the small development screen
 Add weather and seasons
 Add internet links to units (to see technology available)
 Add internet links to tiles (to see what 'bad' looks like)
 Add animation for stages
 Add pathfinding for power and roads
 Add lines to power sources
 Add cost of distance
 
 Add good-better-best to store/detail selection (so list isn't giant)
 Add TOTAL STATUS (combine sustain scores for each resource into one value >=0 good <0 bad)
 Add CONTRACT DAY (number of days passed in contract)(maybe countdown is better) to control page
 Add ProgressToGoal (how close are we to the milestone)
 Fix UnitName - and use it in notes (who gave notice) (old format was TYPE+LOC)
 Change Detail:DONE to return to Store (and stay there)
 Save GameState on exit (write to file so can open at last state)
 Add END/QUIT to stop the game (or restart it)
 Add Open Last (to open game from exit state)
 Add TotalStatus to ???
 DONE: Add Warehouse page to show placed and unplaced units (maybe health, etc)
 DONE: Check Repair-Wearout in DoProduction (seems to stop) - number type wrong ... integer versus float
 DONE: Fix MapScaleOnReturn - after buying unit and returning to map the zoomscale = 1 and not last value
 DONE: Add BuyIt to Detail page
 DONE: Change BuyIt unit placement orientation so rotated perpendicular to slope
 DONE: Fix MapZoomScale for status bar when zooming
 DONE: Fix bug - in landscape, buyit puts unit in the wrong position (far to the right and maybe down a bit)
 DONE: Add bank account to control page
